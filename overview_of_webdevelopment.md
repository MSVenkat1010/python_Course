## Types of websites:

1. Static websites
2. Dynamic websites
   - **Client side rendered apps:**
     Client-Side Rendered (CSR) apps are a type of web application where the majority of the page rendering, content creation, and data processing occurs on the client-side (in the user's browser) rather than the server-side. This approach provides a dynamic and interactive user experience.
     - *Single Page apps:*
       A Single Page Application (SPA) is a web application or website that interacts with the user by dynamically rewriting the current web page, rather than loading entire new pages from the server. SPAs provide a more seamless and responsive user experience by loading data as needed and updating the UI without full page reloads.
     - *Progressive web apps:*
       Progressive Web Apps (PWAs) are web applications that work on various devices and browsers, offering a seamless, fast, and reliable user experience. They have features like offline access, quick loading, and the ability to add to a device's home screen. PWAs bridge the gap between web and native mobile apps, delivering app-like functionalities directly through a web browser.
   - **Server side rendered apps:**  
     Server-Side Rendered (SSR) apps are a type of web application where the page rendering and content generation occur on the server-side before being sent to the client's browser. Unlike Client-Side Rendered (CSR) apps, which perform rendering on the client-side, SSR apps generate a complete HTML page on the server. This approach has advantages such as improved SEO (Search Engine Optimization), faster initial page loading, and better accessibility for search engines and users with disabilities.
